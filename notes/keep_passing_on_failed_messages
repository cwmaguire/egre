Keep Passing on Failed Messages

July 9, 2016

Broadcasting messages only to children relies on messages stopping when they are failed.

My logic here was that if something needs to react to an event then
we need to keep passing on the attempts even after one handler fails
the attempt.

Wrong. If the attempt doesn’t succeed then _nothing_ happened. For example. If I attempt to open the door, but the door is locked then … I attempted to open the door. Crap. If I _try_ and open a door I should have logic on that. 

“You hear someone try to open the door."

“You try to open the door and are shocked with n volts of electricity."

So, I’ll need to register the attempt without passing it. I’ll
probably do this by kicking of an ‘x_attempt’ message so that
other processes can react to the attempt even though the attempt
itself failed.
