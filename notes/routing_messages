handle_attempt call out to Type module merge self() with the done
procs merge any connected procs with the still-to-be-notified procs
If there are no still-to-be-notified procs then tell everyone that we
succeeded else pass “attempt” on to the next proc with the
updated lists of who is done, who is not, and what the room is

So long as you pass back a resend no proc will get a succeed message
and no proc will ever care that the original message died and will
never be heard from again.
