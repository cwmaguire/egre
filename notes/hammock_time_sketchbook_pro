I have no idea where I was going with "> SketchBook Pro".
I don't even remember what SKetchBook Pro is. Something for the Wacom tablet?

Rich Hickey talks about “hammock time”.

(Amazing video, just watched it again … at 2x speed.)

Rich actually talks about writing down what the problem is, check,
drawing pictures, check,
sleeping on it, check,
workingon it for several days, check.

I should actually note all the different things he talks about.Some are going to take serious discipline.
