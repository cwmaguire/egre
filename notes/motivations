In very creative games anything could be a need: blood, brains, darkness, cold, violence, calm, sound, quiet, certain frequencies of sound, quietness on certain frequences, electricity, any chemical, any mineral, any gas, thoughts, sex, adreneline, spirits, favour of the powerful, trust, transistors, computer parts, metals, plastics, certain wavelengths of light, radiation, etc.

Why would we do anything in the MUD?

To get something we want?

What do we want?

What we always want:
- shelter
- oxygen
- light
- warmth
- help
- safety
- food
  - not starving is a huge factor in several games:
    - 7DTD, "Dont' Starve", Project Zomboid, Core Keeper, etc.
- money - every game ever
- power
  - spells
  - skills
  - weapons
  - armor
- reputation
  - exclusivity
  - wealth
  - rare items
  - high scores
- victory / mastery

What in-game motivations would we have?
i.e. you need to kills spiders. Why?
Because people can't farm because of the spiders.
Why do we care?
Because farmers make food.

Sources and sinks.
We need a sink (demand) to make a source (supply) valuable.

demand:
- spell ingredients
- ammunition
  - arrows, bullets, knives, battery cells, grenades, flash bangs, traps
- food
- medicine
- consumables
  - bait
- repair
  - weapons, tools, armor, tanks, vehicles, robots
- healing

It would be fun to have your activities guided by what you need: I need mithril arrows so I need to either clear out the mithril mine, or mine mithril myself.
