Motivations

Why would we do anything in the MUD?

To get something we want?

What do we want?

What we also want:
- money
- power
  - spells
  - skills
  - weapons
  - armor
- reputation
  - exclusivity
  - wealth
  - rare items
  - high scores
- victory / mastery

What in-game motivations would we have?
i.e. you need to kills spiders. Why?
Because people can't farm because of the spiders.
Why do we care?
Because farmers make food.

Sources and sinks.
We need a sink (demand) to make a source (supply) valuable.

demand:
- spell ingredients
- ammunition
  - arrows, bullets, knives, battery cells, grenades, flash bangs, traps
- food
- medicine
- consumables
  - bait
- repair
  - weapons, tools, armor, tanks, vehicles, robots
- healing

It would be fun to have your activities guided by what you need: I need mithril arrows so I need to either clear out the mithril mine, or mine mithril myself.
