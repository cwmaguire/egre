Object Died

Jan 27, 2016

If we restart the process with the same ID then other processes can be notified of the new PID for that ID and reconnect to it.
We either need a central or distributed ID-&gt;PID registry. We already have a name-&gt;PID registry, I think.

An object dies.
If we simply restart an object it won’t know what kind of object it is.
We could backup the object’s properties: - ETS - DETS - In other objects - In a backup companion object
I need to come up with some other options: - the object could just disappear - child objects would disappear or be orphaned - use the name of the process ... - will not have a name - each object could be a queue of processes ready to step in - The supervisor could back up all the properties - unless we had a bunch of supervisors this wouldn’t be a good idea - re-read the starting state - e.g. the object would go back to it’s starting room and have it’s starting properties - constantly spin off back-up processes and the recover them - Write properties to file This would actually be kind of cool: recreate a file structure to match the ownership hierarchy
Why do I care? Well, because one process dying (e.g. a room, bag, monster, etc) should cripple the entire mud.
