NOTES ABOUT MULTIATTACK


TODO:

1) make sure generic attack handlers register with resources

  check

2) make sure items have top items

  check

3) make sure items have parent body parts

  An item in a wielding body part can kick off an attack
  with itself as the attacking item

  check

    The generic handler attached to a process will kick of an item
    specific attack and then check if it's wielded and active.

3.1)  A sub-item can recognize an attack where the attack item
      is its "top level item"

    check
    uncheck

      I think I broke this by taking out the original custom item attack handler

      I can fix this by having the custom item attack handler subscribe to attacks
      by the top item, but then how does the regular attack handler latch on to that?

      If the custom attack handler takes it, then it has to duplicate the generic
      attack handler logic.

      Then again, all it needs to do is participate in calc_hit and calc_damage.

      erlmud_handler_attribute_attack has a good setup, I should use that if I can figure
      out why proplists:value(top_item, Props) would return 'item'

    check again

      I've added a #top_item{item = ..., is_active = ..., is_wielded = ...} record
      that I can pass to child objects of items. This tells the child items if the parent
      is participating in attacks.

3.2)  This is done with "set_child_property" to "broadcast"
      a property down to all children (such as "our character
      is _______")

    check

3.3) How do I know if an item can attack?
  Some examples:
    Anything held in the hands:
      knife
      shield
      torch
      gun
      fork
      nothing
    Antything mounted as a weapon:
      laser turret
    Any mind attack:
      spell
      psionic power
      mutant mental ability

  Maybe have "body_part_type" and then have items that look for that
  type?
    Maybe some weapons just need any body part as a parent: e.g.
    a laser turret.

    Maybe "hand weapons" need to be held in the hands.

    Yeah, create a body_part_type that's required and then allow
    for "any".

    Make it attack_body_part_type to distinguish from the 'body_parts'
    property of items. The 'body_parts' property says what body parts
    an item can be added to: e.g. a ring can only go on a finger (unless)
    it's an alien or the ring is not a human finger-sized ring.

      What's an example of something that can be worn on a body part
      but could not be attacked with? Something that's not ridiculous,
      like a sword on a foot.

    check

      There is now a 'wielded_body_parts' property that tracks which body
      parts an item can be attached to and be able to participate in an
      attack.

4) Finish the generic handler that allows any item, body_part,
   spell, or anything else to participate in attacks.

    check

      I'll keep this as a stand-in until I need custom logic

5) Convert the "Owner" param in events to a record that has:
   - Owner
   - Character
   - Top Item
   ... so I don't have to look them up.

    check

6) Have the character kick off a "stop attack on Target" attempt
   when the character moves.

    check

      The attack vector resource handlers listen for a character
      move and unreserve the resource: no more resources, no more
      attacks.

7) Have attack vectors stop attacking on parent character death

    check

8) Resource properties should be PIDs, not names

  We shouldn't need _resource_inject_self if we have the pids
  of the resources.

  Each character resource would need it's own unique name


ASSUME NETWORK COST IS ZERO

All attack objects register with the resource objects.

When the resource objects send out a tick attempt the attack
objects subscribe.
  No. What if tick means the multiple different attack objects
  can go?

  When the resource tick succeeds then, if the resource has
  enough for any attack objects then it sends out an allocation
  attempt.

  attack objects register to their own allocation events

Every object can affect the tick and either fail it or bump
up the reource tick amount.

When the allocation succeeds, the attack objects, if they have
all the resources they need, can then start a calc_hit attempt.



So I need:

resource object




I don't need a separate attack process.

  If I have an attack process then it needs to have the properties
  of it's parent object (e.g. weapon, spell, hand, anything wielded)

  Actually, handlers aren't objects. Each object gets a set of handlers and
  each handler gets the properties of the object when it handles an
  event.

  REMEMBER: objects don't exist, they are just a list of properties.

  (Well, once a list of properties is assigned to a process with a list
   of handlers and non-handler properties then it _is_ a sort of object)

  So I can stick with my current erlmud_handler_item_attack. I could also
  have a body_part_attack, spell_attack, etc.

  I think I'm going to have a generic attack handler that I can attach
  to any object like an item, a body part, a spell, etc.

  What logic would I need that's unique to each attack vector: do I need
  to handle item-specific attacks and spell-specific attacks?

    What would an item attack need?
      - body part - comes from props
      - top-item - props
      - required resources - props
      - attack type - props
        i.e. is this a melee attack? spell? explosion? gun? etc.

      If necessary I can have custom to_hit and damage calc logic
      in process-specific objects: e.g. a sword could have a custom handler
      for to_hit, calc_damage, or both.

      Maybe a custom handler to see if this process _can_ attack?
        e.g. a spell needs to be ... I dunno, memorized? activated?
             a gun needs to be loaded
             a melee weapon must be wielded
             etc.

        However, I _could_ do all of that just with the existence of properties:
        if there are valid body parts from which to attack then there will be a
        property for that. I'd just need to go through the list of attack checks.

        Nah, I think I like custom "can this process attack" handlers better.

      I could have functions in the properties:
        is_interested_fun(#parents{}, Props)
        calc_hit_fun(#parents{}, Props)
        calc_damage_fun(#parents{}, Props)

        ... but that puts me into a kind of meta-coding where I'm loading functions
        up and running them rather than having them hard-coded in a module. I don't
        think that's wise at this point.

  I'm going to go with the idea that anything wielded or "ready" will be used to
  attack.

    Body parts will have to be marked "ready" in order to be used.
    e.g. to strike with a hand the hand will have to be marked ready to strike.

As an aside, a dual-wield situation can be handled by being a bigger drain
on concentration. Potentially even on a "dual-wield" resource. I have a ton
of options for things that can be modelled as drainable resources. A
drainable resource is a great way of communicating between arbitrary sets of
competing objects.

Resources should have a max. If they have the max then they shouldn't send out
a tick attempt.

How would a resource tick handler communicate with a resource
registration handler
  what events will a resource need to handle:
    - tick
    - reservation fulfilled

  I think when a reservation is fulfilled immediate that it can
  send an attempt.

Each object is a list of properties.

  These properties include handlers.

  Each handler must return undefined if it does not handle
  the event.

Cases where something reserves a resource:
  - Nothing else has reserved -> start ticking
  - Something else has reserved -> keep ticking

Cases where something unreserves a resource
  - Nothing else has reserved -> stop ticking
  - Something else has reserved -> keep ticking


ALL ITEMS AND BODY PARTS CAN ATTACK

All items and body parts can attack by having an erlmud_handler_attack
handler.

Each items attack handler will be responsible for registering with all
necessary resources belonging to the character that is the ancestor of
the process.

e.g. if the item is a sword then the sword might register with the
stamina and concentration resources of the character that owns the arm
that is weilding the sword.


Additive and Multiplicative Hit/Dmg Modifiers:

In order to mix and match +/- with * I could have four values:
Minus integer,
Plus integer,
Minus multiplier,
Plus multiplier.

Once the attempt is finished I could do:
(Minus integer * minus multiplier) + (Plus integer * plus multiplier)

e.g. if a sword does +2 to hit and a ring does * 1.1 to hit, then
I'd have to add up all the integers, multiple all the scaling, then
apply the scaling to the integers.

e.g. A sword does +2 to hit, a ring does * 1.1 to hit, attacker dexteriy
does +1 to hit, attacker spell does * 2 against the enemy race, the enemy
armor does -3 to hit and the enemy dexterity does * 1.1 to hit. An enemy
priest does a -1 to hit buff and the weather does * 0.5 to hit.

The enemy dexterity shouldn't apply to the _positive_ (i.e. successful)
numbers, it should multiple the negative (i.e. fail) numbers:

Positive: (+2 + 1) * 1.1 * 2 * 0.5 = 3.3
Negative: (-1) * 1.1 = -1.1
Total: 3.3 - 1.1 = 2.2

In this way I can have multiplier effects and additive/subtractive effects.
The base value is 1 so I could even have _only_ multiplier effects.
However, there might have to be a base negative amount as well in case I
only had negative multipliers.
That works out well because +1 + -1 = 0, ... i.e. if nothing affects the
attack it will fail with 0.

So, I'd probably want weapons to have a base damage, and then have skills,
spells, attributes, environment, etc. potentially do multipliers.

At that point I might have a Hit map instead of just a hit number:
#{pos => 1, neg => -1, pos_multiplier => 1, neg_multiplier => 1}

e.g.
{succeed, {C, calc, neg_mult(Hit, NegMult), on, T, with, W}}

where neg_mult/2 is a function that multiplies the negative multiplier
by it's amount. Since the negative multiplier starts out at one that works
out nicely.
