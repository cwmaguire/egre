Message Limits

tl;dr - track searched objects in message
I still want to have message limits but I'm going to track object hierarchies when doing a search.
Every searched object that is ... subscribed? ... will report it's description.
No. Maybe I do need paths. How do I know which objects to output?
Ah, the message. Do subscribed objects get the message? Yes.

I need to limit how far a message can go.
Currently there’s a 1 room limit, but that’s arbitrary.
Now I need to have a search go down the item hierarchy of a character, but not outside the character:
Wizard Pocket1 Pouch Pocket2 Small box Envelope Bag
So I’m thinking I can set a “gate” object.
However, a room gate object allows going to adjacent rooms.
Maybe a gate operator?
“connected to" “within"
Then _every_ message needs a gate operator, … unless I make “within 1 room" the default
What would a “within two rooms” marker look like?
{within, 1, room, [Room1, {Room1, Room2}]}
I’d have to check if the current room was connected to the current exit, or if one of the paths was.
I _think_ I need to store the path, otherwise how could I tell if I’d reached the limit on number of rooms.
Oh, store the number.
But then how do I know if I’ve been down that path yet?
i.e. I might go back and forth or hit the same room from multiple paths.
“Is my room on the end of any path that is shorter than the max path length?"
e.g. max path length is 3, I’m connected to [Room1, Room2], so I’m valid.
e.g. max path length is 1, I’m connected to [Room1], so I’m not valid.
“Am I within object A?"
e.g. path {A, B, C} exists and my parent is C, so I’m valid.
e.g. path {A, B, C} exists and my parent is D, so I'm invalid.
path_to within
